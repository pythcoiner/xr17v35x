# xr17v35x.c driver for MaxLinear PCI Family of UARTs (XR17V258/254/252/358/354/352/8358/4358/8354) (XR17D158/154/152)

This drivers have not been updated on MaxLinear website since 2019, and  breaking changes have been introduced in
Linux kernel V6.0.0 & V6.1.0 on the API used by this driver.

This repo try to fix theses changes but, as don't have hardware in hand at the moment, the changes have not
been tested yet.
